	<h6> By Jeffrey Cooper </h6>

	<p> I am taking this microcredential because I am interested in becoming a software engineer and its high paying career path. I am currently a student at <strong>CUNY School of Professional Studies</strong> pursuing a business degree but I have
		always been interested in computer science. I am totally new to programming and I wanted to learn different languages. I have one more semester of school left before I graduate and apply for internships and entry level positions. This
		micrcredential sounded like a great opportunity in learning and shifting into this field. I've tried in the past to learn on my own via codeacademy, udemy, etc. but I've found myslef losing interest after a few day. I beleive being able to work
		together with classmates will help me stay interested.</p>
